//! This example shows how to serve static files at specific
//! mount points, and then delegate the rest of the paths to a router.
//!
//! It serves the docs from target/doc at the /docs/ mount point
//! and delegates the rest to a router, which itself defines a
//! handler for route /hello
//!
//! Make sure to generate the docs first with `cargo doc`,
//! then build the tests with `cargo test`,
//! then run the example with `./target/router`
//!
//! Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello to view the routed path.
//!
//! Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs/mount/ to view the mounted docs.
